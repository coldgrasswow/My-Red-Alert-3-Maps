# My Small Public Red Alert 3 Home-Made Maps Repository/我的小型红警3自制地图公用仓库

  这里是急躁且冰草（断剑却闪灵）的红警3自制地图文件夹小型公用仓库，目前地图分类主要为日冕MOD类和原版类这两大类。本人最近主要做日冕MOD类地图，因为个人的现实生活和灵感的稀有度等原因，新地图的制作和上传时间安排基本随缘，如果你喜欢我的地图你可以随时从这里按需要下载你想要的地图。不求能被多少人收藏关注，若你喜欢并下载了我的地图那便是我巨大的荣幸，谢谢各位红警3玩家们！

  This is the small public repository for map folders of Red Alert 3 made by Coldgrass(also called Brokensword) including 2 major varieties about Corona MOD and OriginalVersion(v1.12) recently. I have been making maps in Corona MOD with my major vim. Because of my daily life and the rarity of inspiration, I have to let the time arrangement of making and uploading new maps be. You could download my maps which you want at anytime if you like those. No matter how many players subscribe or star there, it's my honor that you like and download my maps. Thanks for every RA3 players!

 ## Latest Notification/最新通知

   由于最新版日冕MOD对遭遇战AI的更新，建议各位玩家玩任何日冕MOD遭遇战战役地图选择遭遇战AI难度时最高只选择到第3等级难度即可（日冕MOD遭遇战AI的第3难度为“凶残”，第4难度也就是最高难度为“地狱”），尽量不要让敌方遭遇战AI和遭遇战AI队友地狱级的疯狂建造、爆兵和攻击瘫痪了你们的电脑和CPU！

   With the recent update of Corona MOD on skirmish AI, the 3rd level difficulty is already enough for every Corona MOD gamers to play any skirmish campaign map on Corona MOD (the 3rd level difficulty of skirmish AI in Corona MOD is "Brutal", the 4th one is "Hellish"). Try not to let the runaway constructions, units and attacks from enemies' AIs and allies' AIs crash your computers and CPUs!
