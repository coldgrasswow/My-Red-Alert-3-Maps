# 部分日冕地图游玩前须知/Notice Before Playing Partial COR Maps

1. Chromosphere_Defense_V2.4 【ONLY FOR CORONA】
* 中文（zh-cn）：

  因为日冕MOD自3.190版本给AI指挥官利塞特和夏娜安装了多序列建造行为脚本的原因==（相当于默认给盟苏这两个AI女指挥官额外提供了一个MCV或起重机）==，AI队友夏娜会因为额外的建造序列建造起苏联T3高科直接导致游戏失败==【这两个女指挥官的额外建造序列目前完全不受地编建造受限脚本的限制！！！！】==，因此目前请单人游玩本图的玩家千万不要选择苏联AI夏娜作为你的队友来玩这个地图，除非这个AI天生额外建造序列不受地编脚本限制的BUG被日冕制作组给修复**｛第3等级凶残难度下夏娜的额外建造序列会在蛋蛋车造出来后激活｝**！！！！

* 英文（en）：

  Since the update of Corona MOD in V3.190 and the higher version was released, the skirmish AI commanders Zhana from Soviet and Lycette from Allies each have 2 buliding sequences of their own now though they each have an constuction yard ==(This is equivalent to them having an extra construction yard but it cannot activate their top secret protocols that need to be used manually.)== . Therefore, **Brutal(3rd skirmish AI level) Zhana in Corona MOD will make players defeated when building a Soviet-Tech-3 structure with her extra buliding sequence which is activated after she produces a Sputnik vehicle.** ==[Zhana and Lycette's extra buliding sequences haven't been limited by the scripts of (MOD-SDK) WorldBulider until now!!!!]== If you're a single player to play this map now, please do not choose Zhana to be your AI co-commander in this map except their unlimited buliding sequences BUG is fixed by the MOD developers!!!!
